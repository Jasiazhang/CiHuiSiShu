The suggestion that it is related by umlaut to brood and breed is rejected by OED as \"quite inadmissible.\" Metathesis of -r- and -i- was complete 15c.  Middle English, in which bird referred to various young animals and even human beings, may have preserved the original meaning of this word. Despite its early attestation, bridd is not necessarily the oldest form of bird. It is usually assumed that -ir- from -ri- arose by metathesis, but here, too, the Middle English form may go back to an ancient period. [Liberman]  Figurative sense of \"secret source of information\" is from 1540s. Bird dog (n.) attested from 1832, a gun dog used in hunting game birds; hence the verb (1941) meaning \"to follow closely.\" Bird-watching attested from 1897. Bird\u0027s-eye view is from 1762.

Splankhnon was used in Septuagint to translate a Hebrew word, and from thence early Bibles in English rendered it in its literal sense as bowels, which thus acquired in English a secondary meaning of \"pity, compassion\" (late 14c.).

The term romantic in this sense means strongly marked, extraordinary, intending to tell stories and the like. [\"Music, Its Ideals and Methods,\" W.S.B. Mathews, 1897]  But already by 1880s it was acknowledged the term had a double sense: Music that had withstood the test of time, as well as music of a style contrasted to \"romantic.\" Later (early 20c.) it was contrasted to jazz (in this sense more often with reference to the orchestras than to the music itself).

{"spell":"conservative","phonetic":"kənˈsə:vətiv","etymology":"late 14c., conservatyf, from M.Fr. conservatif, from L.L. conservativus, from L. conservatus, pp. of conservare (see conserve). As a modern political tradition, conservatism traces to Edmund Burke\u0027s opposition to the French Revolution (1790), but the word conservative is not found in his writing. It was coined by his French disciples, (e.g. Chateaubriand, who titled his journal defending clerical and political restoration \"Le Conservateur\"). Conservative as the name of a British political faction first appeared in an 1830 issue of the \"Quarterly Review,\" in an unsigned article sometimes attributed to John Wilson Croker. It replaced Tory (q.v.) by 1843, reflecting both a change from the pejorative name (in use for 150 years) and repudiation of some reactionary policies. Extended to similar spirits in other parties from 1845.Strictly speaking, conservatism is not a political system, but rather a way of looking at the civil order. The conservative of Peru ... will differ greatly from those of Australia, for though they may share a preference for things established, the institutions and customs which they desire to preserve are not identical.

Thus kosmos had an important secondary sense of \"ornaments of a woman\u0027s dress, decoration\" (cf. kosmokomes \"dressing the hair\") as well as \"the universe, the world.\" Pythagoras is said to have been the first to apply this word to \"the universe,\" perhaps originally meaning \"the starry firmament,\" but later it was extended to the whole physical world, including the earth. For specific reference to \"the world of people,\" the classical phrase was he oikoumene (ge) \"the inhabited (earth).\" Septuagint uses both kosmos and oikoumene.

{"spell":"cotton","phonetic":"ˈkɔtən","etymology":"as a deprecatory term first recorded in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but a similar noun meaning \"contemptible person\" dates to around 1919, perhaps with racist overtones that have faded over the years. Before mechanization, cotton picking was the most difficult labor on a cotton plantation.  I drove out to a number of the farms near Denison and found many very young white children working all day in the hot sun picking and dragging sacks of cotton. In one field the labor corps consisted of one woman and six children, one of them 5 years, one 6 years, one 7 years, one 9 years, and two about 11. The father was plowing. The 5 and 6 year olds worked all day as did the rest. The 7-year-old said he picked 50 pounds a day and the 9 year old 75 pounds. (A good picker averages several hundred a day.) School begins late on account of the cotton picking, but the children nearly all prefer school to the picking. Picking hours are long, hot, and deadly monotonous. While the very young children seem to enjoy it, very soon their distaste for it grows into all-absorbing hatred for all work. [\"Field Notes of Lewis W.

O.Ir. tuoth \"people,\" O.Lith. tauta \"people,\" O.Prus. tauto \"country,\" Oscan touto \"community\").  As a language name, first recorded as L. theodice, 786 C.E. in correspondence between Charlemagne\u0027s court and the Pope, in reference to a synodical conference in Mercia; thus it refers to Old English. First reference to the German language (as opposed to a Germanic one) is two years later. The sense was extended from the language to the people who spoke it (in German, Diutisklant, ancestor of Deutschland, was in use by 13c.).  Sense narrowed to \"of the Netherlands\" in 17c., after they became a united, independent state and the focus of English attention and rivalry. In Holland, Duits (formerly duitsch) is used of the people of Germany. The M.E. sense survives in Pennsylvania Dutch, name of the people who immigrated from the Rhineland and Switzerland.  Since c.1600, Dutch (adj.) has been a \"pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to \u0027normal\u0027 (i.e., their own) practice\" [Rawson]. E.g. Dutch treat (1887), Dutch uncle (1838), etc. -- probably exceeded in such usage only by Indian and Irish -- reflecting first British commercial and military rivalry and later heavy German immigration to U.S.  The Dutch themselves spoke English well enough to understand the unsavory connotations of the label and in 1934 Dutch officials were ordered by their government to stop using the term Dutch. Instead, they were to rewrite their sentences so as to employ the official The Netherlands. [Rawson]  Dutch oven is from 1769; OED lists it among the words describing things from Holland, but perhaps it is here used in the slighting sense. Dutch elm disease (1927) so called because it was first discovered in Holland (caused by fungus Ceratocystis ulmi).","type":8}

Meaning \"uncomfortable, sorry\" is 1839, Amer.Eng. colloquial.  Comparable words in the other I.E. languages tend to have grown from descriptions of specific qualities, such as \"ugly,\" \"defective,\" \"weak,\" \"faithless,\" \"impudent,\" \"crooked,\" \"filthy\" (e.g. Gk. kakos, probably from the word for \"excrement;\" Rus. plochoj, related to O.C.S. plachu \"wavering, timid;\" Pers. gast, O.Pers. gasta-, related to gand \"stench;\" Ger. schlecht, originally \"level, straight, smooth,\" whence \"simple, ordinary,\" then \"bad\").  Comparative and superlative forms badder, baddest were common 14c.-18c. and used as recently as Defoe (but not by Shakespeare), but yielded to comp. worse and superl. worst (which had belonged to evil and ill).  As a noun, late 14c., \"evil, wickedness.\" In U.S. place names, sometimes translating native terms meaning \"supernaturally dangerous.\" Ironic use as a word of approval is said to be at least since 1890s orally, originally in Black Eng., emerging in print 1928 in a jazz context. It might have emerged from the ambivalence of expressions like bad nigger, used as a term of reproach by whites, but among blacks sometimes representing one who stood up to injustice, but in the U.S. West bad man also had a certain ambivalence:  These are the men who do most of the killing in frontier communities, yet it is a noteworthy fact that the men who are killed generally deserve their fate. [Farmer \u0026 Henley]  *Farsi has bad in more or less the same sense as the English word, but this is regarded by linguists as a coincidence. The forms of the words diverge as they are traced back in time (Farsi bad comes from M.Pers. vat), and such accidental convergences exist across many languages, given the vast number of words in each and the limited range of sounds humans can make to signify them.

{"spell":"gay","phonetic":"ɡei","etymology":"late 14c., \"full of joy, merry; light-hearted, carefree;\" also \"wanton, lewd, lascivious\" (late 12c. as a surname, Philippus de Gay), from O.Fr. gai \"joyful, happy; pleasant, agreeably charming; forward, pert\" (12c.; cf. O.Sp. gayo, Port. gaio, It. gajo, probably French loan-words). Ultimate origin disputed; perhaps from Frankish *gahi (cf. O.H.G. wahi \"pretty\"), though not all etymologists accept this. Meaning \"stately and beautiful; splendid and showily dressed\" is from early 14c. The word gay by the 1890s had an overall tinge of promiscuity -- a gay house was a brothel. The suggestion of immorality in the word can be traced back at least to the 1630s, if not to Chaucer:  But in oure bed he was so fressh and gay Whan that he wolde han my bele chose.  Slang meaning \"homosexual\" (adj.) begins to appear in psychological writing late 1940s, evidently picked up from gay slang and not always easily distinguished from the older sense:  After discharge A.Z. lived for some time at home. He was not happy at the farm and went to a Western city where he associated with a homosexual crowd, being \"gay,\" and wearing female clothes and makeup. He always wished others would make advances to him. [\"Rorschach Research Exchange and Journal of Projective Techniques,\" 1947, p.240]  The association with (male) homosexuality likely got a boost from the term gay cat, used as far back as 1893 in Amer.Eng. for \"young hobo,\" one who is new on the road, also one who sometimes does jobs.  \"A Gay Cat,\" said he, \"is a loafing laborer, who works maybe a week, gets his wages and vagabonds about hunting for another \u0027pick and shovel\u0027 job. Do you want to know where they got their monica (nickname) \u0027Gay Cat\u0027? See, Kid, cats sneak about and scratch immediately after chumming with you and then get gay (fresh). That\u0027s why we call them \u0027Gay Cats\u0027.\" [Leon Ray Livingston (\"America\u0027s Most Celebrated Tramp\"), \"Life and Adventures of A-no. 1,\" 1910]  Quoting a tramp named Frenchy, who might not have known the origin. Gay cats were severely and cruelly abused by \"real\" tramps and bums, who considered them \"an inferior order of beings who begs of and otherwise preys upon the bum -- as it were a jackal following up the king of beasts\" [Prof. John J. McCook, \"Tramps,\" in \"The Public Treatment of Pauperism,\" 1893], but some accounts report certain older tramps would dominate a gay cat and employ him as a sort of slave. In \"Sociology and Social Research\" (1932-33) a paragraph on the \"gay cat\" phenomenon notes, \"Homosexual practices are more common than rare in this group,\" and gey cat \"homosexual boy\" is attested in N. Erskine\u0027s 1933 dictionary of \"Underworld \u0026 Prison Slang\" (gey is a Scottish variant of gay).  The \"Dictionary of American Slang\" reports that gay (adj.) was used by homosexuals, among themselves, in this sense since at least 1920. Rawson [\"Wicked Words\"] notes a male prostitute using gay in reference to male homosexuals (but also to female prostitutes) in London\u0027s notorious Cleveland Street Scandal of 1889. Ayto [\"20th Century Words\"] calls attention to the ambiguous use of the word in the 1868 song \"The Gay Young Clerk in the Dry Goods Store,\" by U.S. female impersonator Will S. Hays, but the word evidently was not popularly felt in this sense by wider society until the 1950s at the earliest.  \"Gay\" (or \"gai\") is now widely used in French, Dutch, Danish, Japanese, Swedish, and Catalan with the same sense as the English. It is coming into use in Germany and among the English-speaking upper classes of many cosmopolitan areas in other countries. [John Boswell, \"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality,\" 1980]  Gay as a noun meaning \"a (usually male) homosexual\" is attested from 1971; in M.E. it meant \"excellent person, noble lady, gallant knight,\" also \"something gay or bright; an ornament or badge\" (c.1400).","type":2}

The Greek and Roman Churches have long disputed about the beard. While the Romanists have at different times practised shaving, the Greeks, on the contrary, have sternuously defended the cause of long beards. Leo III. (795 AD) was the first shaved Pope. Pope Gregory IV., after the lapse of only 30 years, fulminated a Bull against bearded priests. In the 12th century the prescription of the beard was extended to the laity. Pope Honorius III. to disguise his disfigured lip, allowed his beard to grow. Henry I. of England was so much moved by a sermon directed against his beard that he resigned it to the barber. Frederick Barbarossa is said to have been equally tractable. [Tom Robinson, M.D., \"Beards,\" \"St. James\u0027s Magazine,\" 1881]","type":1}

Perhaps from V.L. *rattus, but Weekley thinks this is of Germanic origin, \"the animal having come from the East with the race-migrations\" and the word passing thence to the Romanic languages.

Middle English common form was ratton, from augmented O.Fr. form raton. Sense of \"one who abandons his associates\" (1620s) is from belief that rats leave a ship about to sink or a house about to fall and led to meaning \"traitor, informant\" (1902; verb 1910).

{"spell":"relieved","phonetic":"rɪˈli:vd","etymology":"from the title of Joseph Heller\u0027s 1961 novel. In widespread use only after release of movie based on the book in 1970. The \"catch\" is that a bomber pilot is insane if he flies combat missions without asking to be relieved from duty, and is thus eligible to be relieved from duty. But if he asks to be relieved from duty, that means he\u0027s sane and has to keep flying. There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one\u0027s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn\u0027t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn\u0027t have to; but if he didn\u0027t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. \"That\u0027s some catch, that Catch-22,\" he observed.\"It\u0027s the best there is,\" Doc Daneeka agreed.

{"spell":"religion","phonetic":"riˈlidʒən","etymology":"c.1200, \"state of life bound by monastic vows,\" also \"conduct indicating a belief in a divine power,\" from Anglo-Fr. religiun (11c.), from O.Fr. religion \"religious community,\" from L. religionem (nom. religio) \"respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods,\" in L.L. \"monastic life\" (5c.); according to Cicero, derived from relegere \"go through again, read again,\" from re- \"again\" + legere \"read\" (see lecture). However, popular etymology among the later ancients (and many modern writers) connects it with religare \"to bind fast\" (see rely), via notion of \"place an obligation on,\" or \"bond between humans and gods.\" Another possible origin is religiens \"careful,\" opposite of negligens. Meaning \"particular system of faith\" is recorded from c.1300.To hold, therefore, that there is no difference in matters of religion between forms that are unlike each other, and even contrary to each other, most clearly leads in the end to the rejection of all religion in both theory and practice.

Jerome\u0027s reading also was followed by Martin Luther (der ledige Bock), Symmachus (tragos aperkhomenos), and others (cf. Fr. bouc émissaire), but the question of who, or what (or even where) is meant by \u0027azazel is a vexed one. The Revised Version (1884) simply restores Azazel. But the old translation has its modern defenders:  Azazel is an active participle or participial noun, derived ultimately from azal (connected with the Arabic word azala, and meaning removed), but immediately from the reduplicate form of that verb, azazal. The reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that while azal means removed, azalzal means removed by a repetition of acts. Azalzel or azazel, therefore, means one who removes by a series of acts. ... The interpretation is founded on sound etymological grounds, it suits the context wherever the word occurs, it is consistent with the remaining ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords with the otherwise known religious beliefs and symbolical practices of the Israelites.

{"spell":"typhoon","phonetic":"taiˈfu:n","etymology":"Tiphon \"violent storm, whirlwind, tornado,\" 1550s, from Gk. typhon \"whirlwind,\" personified as a giant, father of the winds, perhaps from typhein \"to smoke\" (cf. typhus). The meaning \"cyclone, violent hurricane of India or the China Seas\" (1580s) is first recorded in T. Hickock\u0027s translation of an account in Italian of a voyage to the East Indies by Caesar Frederick, a merchant of Venice:  concerning which Touffon ye are to vnderstand, that in the East Indies often times, there are not stormes as in other countreys; but euery 10. or 12. yeeres there are such tempests and stormes, that it is a thing incredible, but to those that haue seene it, neither do they know certainly what yeere they wil come. [\"The voyage and trauell of M. Caesar Fredericke, Marchant of Venice, into the East India, and beyond the Indies\"]  This sense of the word, in reference to titanic storms in the East Indies, first appears in Europe in Portuguese in the mid-16th century. It aparently is from tufan, a word in Arabic, Persian, and Hindi meaning \"big cyclonic storm.\" Yule [\"Hobson-Jobson,\" London, 1903] writes that \"the probability is that Vasco [da Gama] and his followers got the tufao ... direct from the Arab pilots.\" The Arabic word sometimes is said to be from Gk. typhon, but other sources consider it purely Semitic, though the Greek word might have influenced the form of the word in English.  Al-tufan occurs several times in the Koran for \"a flood or storm\" and also for Noah\u0027s Flood. Chinese (Cantonese) tai fung \"a great wind\" also might have influenced the form or sense of the word in English, and that term and the Indian one may have had some mutual influence; toofan still means \"big storm\" in India.","type":9}

Etruscan Turan \"mistress, lady\" (surname of Venus). In the exact sense, a tyrant is an individual who arrogates to himself the royal authority without having a right to it. This is how the Greeks understood the word \u0027tyrant\u0027: they applied it indifferently to good and bad princes whose authority was not legitimate. [Rousseau, \"The Social Contract\"]  The spelling with -t arose in O.Fr. by analogy with prp. endings in -ant. Fem. form tyranness is recorded from 1590 (Spenser); cf.

Extended sense of \"morally offensive\" is attested from c.1300; that of \"ill-tempered\" is from 1680s.  Among words for this concept, ugly is unusual in being formed from a root for \"fear, dread.\" More common is a compound meaning \"ill-shaped\" (e.g. Gk. dyseides, L. deformis, Ir. dochrud, Skt. ku-rupa). Another Germanic group has a root sense of \"hate, sorrow\" (see loath). Ugly duckling (1877) is from the story by Hans Christian Andersen, first translated from Danish to English 1846.
